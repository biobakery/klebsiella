This step creates an index from WGLW5-fix.fa (reference), aligns each strain's reads into a sam file, sorts the sam,
and creates a bam for each strain.

Usage: sh make_bam.sh
Inputs: all the fastqs for each strain, gzipped, in the directory "data".
Outputs: a *-sorted.bam and *-sorted.bai for each strain *.

Note: the fastq.gz are not included and need to be downloaded from **URL**.

2. bed.sh

This step calculates coverage gaps for each strain and creates a bed file for each strain, showing the coverage gaps.

Usage: sh bed.sh

Prerequisite: bedtools
Inputs: the *-sorted.bam files for each strain produced in step 1.
