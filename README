1.  make_bam.sh

This step creates an index from WGLW5-fix.fa (reference), aligns each strain's reads into a sam file, sorts the sam,
and creates a bam for each strain.

Prerequisite: bowtie2, samtools, fastqs for each strain.
Usage: sh make_bam.sh
Inputs: all the fastqs for each strain, gzipped, in the directory "data".
Outputs: a *-sorted.bam and *-sorted.bai for each strain *.

Note: the fastq.gz are not included and need to be downloaded from **URL**.

2. coverage-bed.sh (formerly bed.sh)

This step calculates coverage gaps for each strain and creates a bed file for each strain, showing the coverage gaps.

Usage: sh coverage-bed.sh

Prerequisite: bedtools
Inputs: the *-sorted.bam files for each strain produced in step 1.
Outputs: *-gaps.bed for each strain.

3. contiguator.sh

This step runs Contiguator on the assembled scaffolds for each strain, aligning them to the WGLW5-fix scaffold.
A 5kb minimum length cutoff is imposed. 

Usage: sh contiguator.sh

Prerequisite: Contiguator installed & added to path (see shell script)
Inputs: the scaffolds for each strain.
Outputs: Contiguator PDFs and alignment descriptions.

4. feature-beds.sh

This script creates bed files of each strain's features and contig boundaries relative to the reference genome.
It uses blat, prokka outputs, and contiguator outputs.

Usage: sh feature-beds.sh

Prerequisite: Blat. Outputs from step 3. Prokka outputs (need to be downloaded from **URL**).
